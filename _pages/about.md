Welcome to my homepage! 

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University.


My research interests include <u>Multi-modal Learning</u>, <u>Efficient Deep Learning</u>, and <u>Large Language Models</u>.
